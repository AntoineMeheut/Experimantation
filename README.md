# Experimentation (Code only focus)

* Sample Application with Python and Flask inspired from https://github.com/sheetalbongale/austin-sharedmobility-webapp,
* To demonstrate how a developer can focus only on his code and carry out all his work only from his repository, while immediately obtaining the result of his development in production.

## This demonstration uses

* Gitpod https://www.gitpod.io/ to develop code
* Python and Flash for website development
* Scalingo https://scalingo.com to deploy in production on Outscale
