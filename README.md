# Experimentation with code only focus

* Sample application with python and flask inspired from [sheetalbongale](https://github.com/sheetalbongale/austin-sharedmobility-webapp),
* To demonstrate how a developer can focus only on his code and carry out all his work only from his repository, while immediately obtaining the result of its developments in production.

## This demonstration uses

* [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) to develop code,
* Python and flask for website development,
* [Scalingo](https://scalingo.com) to deploy in production on Outscale.
